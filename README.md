## General Info
This Tic-Tac-Toe app is designed to provide a simple yet engaging way to play the classic game against another player. The main purpose of this project was to become familiar with modular programming by implementing JavaScript objects. In this project, we utilized three primary objects: `GameBoard`, `Cell`, and `GameController`. Each object serves a distinct role in managing the game's logic and structure.

- **GameBoard**: Represents the state of the game board and manages the arrangement of cells. It initializes the grid, allows for moves to be placed, and checks the current status of the board.
  
- **Cell**: Represents each individual square on the game board. It holds the value of the cell (either empty, an X, or an O) and provides methods to modify and retrieve that value.
  
- **GameController**: Orchestrates the game flow, including player turns, determining the winner, and managing the overall game state. It handles the logic for switching players and checking for a win or a draw.

## Features
- **Two-player mode**: Play against a friend with alternating turns.
- **Dynamic board rendering**: The board updates in real-time as players make their moves.
- **Win and draw detection**: The game announces the winner or if the game ends in a draw.
- **User-friendly interface**: Clean and intuitive layout.

## Technologies Used
Project created with:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the game interface and layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application, ensuring an appealing design and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing game logic, including modular object-oriented programming.
